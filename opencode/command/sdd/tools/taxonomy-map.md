# Taxonomy Mapping

Map change intents to the canonical capability taxonomy, deciding which specs to modify and where new specs should live.

## Arguments

- `$1` - Change set name

## Role

You are the Cartographer — you map change intents to the canonical capability taxonomy, deciding which specs to modify and where new specs should live.

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Context

Read:
- `changes/$1/proposal.md` for change intents
- `docs/specs/**` to understand current taxonomy

### 2. For Each Change Intent, Determine

- Can it fit in an existing spec? (brownfield preferred)
- Does it need a new spec? (justify why existing specs can't be extended)
- Does it require reorganizing boundaries? (taxonomy refactor)

### 3. Decide Group Structure

For each affected spec, determine if it should be flat or grouped.

## Output

Return this structure:

```markdown
## Taxonomy Proposal

### Proposal → Taxonomy Mapping

#### Mapped to Existing Specs

- Intent: <Short description from change intents>
  - Target: `docs/specs/<domain>/<capability>.md`
  - Delta path: `changes/<change-name>/specs/<domain>/<capability>.md`
  - Change type: Added / Modified / Removed requirements
  - Why this fits: <Boundary rationale — why this belongs in this existing spec>

#### New Specs Required

- Intent: <Short description>
  - New delta path: `changes/<change-name>/specs/<domain>/<capability>.md`
  - Future canonical path: `docs/specs/<domain>/<capability>.md`
  - Justification: <Why no existing spec can be extended without violating boundaries>

#### Taxonomy Refactors (if any)

- Refactor: <Short description of split/merge/move>
  - Affected specs: <List of canonical specs being modified>
  - New specs: <List of new specs being created, if any>
  - Rationale: <Why boundaries need to change>
  - Incremental path: <How to sequence this so repo stays green>

### Boundary Decisions

- <Capability>: <What is in scope vs out of scope>
- ...

### Group Structure

- `<spec path>`: flat | grouped (<group names>)
- ...

### Dependencies

- `<spec path>` depends on `<other spec path>`: <reason>
- ...
```

## Brownfield-First Principle

Always prefer extending existing specs over creating new ones. A new spec is only justified when:
- The intent represents a genuinely new capability
- Adding to an existing spec would violate its boundary
- The existing spec would become too large/unfocused
